# Bodio
The missing health tracker for Android. Supports way more than a normal tracker should.

### Why another health tracker?
Because others don't do enough. Apple's Health has a lot of measuring, but doesn't offer a good interface for tracking activities and food. Samsung Health is nice, but it misses on actual health data like blood pressure, BMI and other measurements. Google Fit isn't even trying to be a health advisor but offers a lot activities. Other apps don't count because, you know, what other apps do you know?

All the apps we know and love aren't strong enough, aren't capable of everything a human mught need. Bodio comes with a fix to that.

### What can Bodio do now?
Well, technically nothing.

### Oh. What will it be able to do then?

A lot, actually:
* Track a whole lot of stuff: weight and height, blood measurements, and even more specific vitals
* Track food using meal-time principle instead of pure calories tracking
* Track water and caffeine with advices on how to drink right
* Track your exercises and everyday activities
* Track sleep cycles and analyze the best sleep routine
* Keep your medical ID with all the important information
* Sync data to and from other big trackers (Google Fit, Samsung Health, MyFitnessPal, Sleep as Android etc.)
