# Bodio
The missing health tracker for Android. Supports way more than a normal tracker should.

## Why another health tracker?
Because others don't do enough. Apple's Health has a lot of measuring, but doesn't offer a good interface for tracking activities and food. Samsung Health is nice, but it misses on actual health stuff like blood pressure, BMI and other measurements. Google Fit isn't even trying to be a health advisor but offers quite a lot activities. Other apps don't count because, you know, what other apps do you know?

All the apps we know and love aren't strong enough, aren't capable of everything a human mught need. Bodio comes with a fix to that.

## What will Bodio be able to do?

* Track a whole lot of things: weight and height, blood stuff, and even more specific vitals
* Track food using meal-time principle instead of pure calories tracking
* Track water and caffeine with advices on how to drink correctly
* Track your exercises and daily activities
* Track sleep cycles and analyze the best sleep routine
* Keep your medical ID with all the important information
* Sync data to and from other big trackers (Google Fit, Samsung Health, MyFitnessPal, Sleep as Android etc.)
